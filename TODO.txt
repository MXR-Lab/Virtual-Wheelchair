Need to discuss:
- How interactions with the basket will work. I can continue my work with combining meshes but this will likely impact performance. Regardless of how the mesh is created, shirt models need to be changed.
- I would like some of the model groupings to be modified so I can split certain meshes so they actually work with regards to navigation.
- SketchUp loading errors with that one shirt type and the racks.
- Explain tray modification to the wheelchair.
